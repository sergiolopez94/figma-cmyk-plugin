# Figma CMYK Plugin Development Plan

## Overview
Creating a Figma plugin that converts colors to CMYK color space and exports selected files with customizable settings.

## Phase 1: Project Setup & Core Structure
**Objective**: Establish the foundational plugin architecture

### Tasks:
- [ ] Create `manifest.json` with plugin configuration and permissions
- [ ] Set up TypeScript configuration (`tsconfig.json`)
- [ ] Create basic file structure:
  - `code.ts` - Main plugin logic (Figma sandbox)
  - `ui.html` - Plugin UI interface
  - `ui.ts` - UI logic and messaging
- [ ] Set up `package.json` with required dependencies
- [ ] Configure build process

### Deliverables:
- Working plugin skeleton that loads in Figma
- Basic communication between UI and plugin code

---

## Phase 2: CMYK Color Conversion
**Objective**: Implement accurate RGB to CMYK color conversion

### Tasks:
- [ ] Research and implement RGB to CMYK conversion algorithms
- [ ] Create color processing utility functions
- [ ] Add color detection and extraction from Figma nodes
- [ ] Implement color traversal for nested objects
- [ ] Test conversion accuracy with various color samples
- [ ] Handle edge cases (transparent colors, gradients, etc.)

### Deliverables:
- Reliable color conversion system
- Functions to process all colors in selected Figma nodes

---

## Phase 3: Basic UI Framework
**Objective**: Create the plugin's user interface foundation

### Tasks:
- [ ] Set up shadcn UI components integration
- [ ] Implement minimal design system:
  - White backgrounds
  - Light gray borders and text
  - Purple and blue gradient accents
- [ ] Create basic layout structure
- [ ] Establish messaging system between UI and plugin code
- [ ] Add basic form controls and inputs

### Deliverables:
- Clean, minimal plugin UI
- Functional communication system

---

## Phase 4: Export Settings Interface
**Objective**: Build comprehensive export configuration options

### Tasks:
- [ ] Create DPI selection component:
  - Dropdown with presets: 72, 150, 300, 600 DPI
  - Custom input field for manual DPI entry
- [ ] Implement size options:
  - Original size (default)
  - Custom dimensions (width/height inputs)
  - Scale percentage (slider/input)
- [ ] Add format selector:
  - PNG, JPG, PDF options
  - Format-specific settings
- [ ] Create quality/compression controls
- [ ] Add preview of export settings

### Deliverables:
- Complete export settings interface
- Real-time preview of export parameters

---

## Phase 5: File Management
**Objective**: Handle file path selection and user preferences

### Tasks:
- [ ] Implement file path selector with browse button
- [ ] Create settings toggle:
  - "Always ask for location" option
  - "Remember last location" option
- [ ] Set up local storage for user preferences
- [ ] Handle file system permissions and access
- [ ] Create settings persistence system
- [ ] Add validation for file paths and permissions

### Deliverables:
- Functional file management system
- Persistent user preferences

---

## Phase 6: Export Functionality
**Objective**: Implement the core export feature with CMYK support

### Tasks:
- [ ] Implement export functionality using Figma API
- [ ] Apply CMYK color profiles to exported files
- [ ] Handle DPI and size settings during export
- [ ] Support multiple export formats (PNG, JPG, PDF)
- [ ] Add progress indicators for export process
- [ ] Implement error handling and user feedback
- [ ] Add batch export for multiple selections

### Deliverables:
- Fully functional export system
- CMYK-accurate file outputs

---

## Phase 7: Testing & Polish
**Objective**: Ensure reliability and enhance user experience

### Tasks:
- [ ] Test with various Figma design types:
  - Vector graphics
  - Raster images
  - Text elements
  - Complex layouts
- [ ] Validate CMYK conversion accuracy
- [ ] Performance optimization for large files
- [ ] UI/UX refinements and polish
- [ ] Error handling improvements
- [ ] Documentation and user guide
- [ ] Plugin store submission preparation

### Deliverables:
- Production-ready plugin
- Complete documentation
